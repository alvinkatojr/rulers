# Rulers

Ruby on Rulers is a mini implementation of Ruby on Rails meant to provide an understanding of the how rails works and the magic behind. The motto of learning by doing applies here very well.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rulers'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rulers

## Usage

Rulers is a mini framework for building web apps. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags.
